I am a Postdoc in [Autonomous Vision Group](http://cvlibs.net/), a part of the MPI for Intelligent Systems and the University of Tübingen leading by [Prof. Andreas Geiger](https://avg.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/ageiger). I received my Ph.D. in Control Science and Engineering from [Zhejiang University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang_University) in June 2018, where I worked with [Prof. Yong Liu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/yongliu). Before that, I received the B.S. degree from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an_Jiaotong_University) in Automation.

My research interests include computer vision and deep learning, in especially their applications for semantic and geometric scene understanding in 3D. Currently, I am working on 3D reconstruction and simultaneously 2D and 3D scene understanding.
