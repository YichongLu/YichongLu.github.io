I am a Postdoc in [Autonomous Vision Group](http://cvlibs.net/), a part of the University of Tübingen and the MPI for Intelligent Systems, leading by [Prof. Andreas Geiger](https://avg.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/ageiger). I received my Ph.D. in Control Science and Engineering from [Zhejiang University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhejiang_University) in June 2018, where I worked with [Prof. Yong Liu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/yongliu). Before that, I received the B.S. degree from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi%27an_Jiaotong_University).

My research interest lies in 3D computer vision, including 3D scene understanding, 3D reconstruction, depth estimation and 3D controllable image synthesis.
